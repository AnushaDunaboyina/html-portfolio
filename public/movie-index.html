   <h1>The Best Movies According to Anusha</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
    <hr/>
    <h3>Finding Nemo</h3>
    <p>This is one of my all-time favourite movies.  Its beautiful underwater world, lovable characters like Markin
     and Dory, and touching father-son relationship make it a standout. Plus, the humor and life lessons throughtout
     the film keep me coming back to it again and again..</p>

    <h3>Iron Man</h3>
    <p>Iâ€™m a big fan of the 'Iron Man' movies because Tony Stark's character is so dynamic and intriguing. The
     blend of action, humor, and cutting-edge technology keeps me hooked. Plus, Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal brings a
     perfect mix of charm and depth to the role.</p>

    <h3>Rangasthalam</h3>
    <p>I love 'Rangasthalam' because of its captivating story set in the 1980s, the brilliant performance by Ram
     Charan as Chitti Babu, and the strong supporting cast. The film's depiction of village life, the intense drama,
     and the nostalgic elements make it a standout movie.</p>
